# Employee Management System – Capstone Project

This is a simple command-line-based Employee Management System built in Python as part of a capstone project.

## 📌 Project Context
**PT Sukses Selalu** is a fictional tech company based in Jakarta. As the company grows, an efficient internal system to manage employee data becomes essential. This project simulates such a system using basic Python and CLI interaction.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- To simulate real-world employee data management for HR purposes.
- To build a functioning CRUD application using Python.
- To present data in a structured table format using the `tabulate` library.

## ⚙️ Features
- View all employee records in a clean table format
- Add new employee data
- Update existing employee data
- Delete employee records
- Interactive main menu with user input

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python 3
- tabulate (for table display)

## 📁 File Structure
```
Capstone_Tabulate.py       # Main program
README.md                  # Project overview and usage instructions
```

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install tabulate
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python Capstone_Tabulate.py
   ```

## 📋 Sample Data Fields
- ID
- Name
- Position
- Division
- Salary

## 🚧 Limitations
- Data is stored in memory only (no persistent storage)
- No advanced input validation or error handling

## 🔄 Future Improvements
- Add file/database-based data persistence
- Input validation and duplicate ID checks
- GUI or web-based interface (Flask, Streamlit)
